Mastering keyboard shortcuts is one of the fastest ways to boost your productivity as an administrative professional. Moving your hand from the keyboard to the mouse hundreds of times a day creates "micro-latencies" that add up to hours of lost time each month.

Here are 25 essential shortcuts categorized by how you’ll likely use them.
Navigation and Selection

These help you zip through long documents or emails without touching the mouse.

    Ctrl + Left/Right Arrow: Move the cursor one full word at a time.

    Ctrl + Up/Down Arrow: Move the cursor to the beginning of the previous or next paragraph.

    Ctrl + Home: Jump to the very top of a document or page.

    Ctrl + End: Jump to the very bottom of a document or page.

    Shift + Home/End: Select all text from the cursor to the start or end of the line.

    Ctrl + Shift + Home/End: Select all text from the cursor to the start or end of the entire document.

    Ctrl + A: Select all content in the current window.

Efficient Editing

For when you are drafting reports, meeting minutes, or correspondence.

    Ctrl + Backspace: Delete the entire word to the left of the cursor.

    Ctrl + Delete: Delete the entire word to the right of the cursor.

    Ctrl + Z: Undo your last action (the ultimate lifesaver).

    Ctrl + Y: Redo an action you just undid.

    Ctrl + K: Highlight text and press this to quickly insert a hyperlink.

    Ctrl + F: Find a specific word or phrase within a document or webpage.

    Ctrl + H: Find and Replace (perfect for updating a name or date across a whole document).

Window & Task Management

As an admin, you likely have dozens of tabs and apps open. Use these to stay organized.

    Alt + Tab: Toggle between your open applications.

    Windows + D: Instantly hide everything and show your Desktop.

    Windows + Left/Right Arrow: Snap your current window to one side of the screen (great for data entry from one window to another).

    Windows + E: Open File Explorer to find documents quickly.

    Windows + V: Open your Clipboard History. This allows you to see the last several things you copied, not just the most recent one.

    Windows + Shift + S: Take a partial screenshot to quickly grab a specific error message or snippet of info to send in a chat.

Quick Formatting & Systems

    Ctrl + B / I / U: Bold, Italicize, or Underline.

    Ctrl + S: Save your work (do this habitually!).

    Ctrl + P: Bring up the Print menu.

    Windows + L: Lock your computer instantly (essential for privacy when stepping away from your desk).

    Ctrl + Shift + Esc: Open the Task Manager directly if a program freezes.

    Pro Tip: If you frequently use Windows + V, you can "pin" items to your clipboard (like a company address or a standard email sign-off) so they are always available to paste, even after you restart your computer.
