    Tab: Auto-complete. Type the first few letters of a file or folder and hit Tab to fill in the rest.

    Shift + Tab: Cycle backward through the auto-complete suggestions.

    Up / Down Arrow: Cycle through your command history (previously typed commands).

    Ctrl + A (or Home): Move the cursor to the beginning of the line you are currently typing.

    Ctrl + E (or End): Move the cursor to the end of the line.

    Ctrl + Left / Right Arrow: Move the cursor one full word at a time.

    Ctrl + U: Clear the line from the cursor back to the start (great for fixing a mistyped command).

    Ctrl + K: Clear the line from the cursor to the end.

Process Control

Crucial for managing scripts, servers, or long-running tasks.

    Ctrl + C: Interrupt/Abort. Stop the currently running command or script immediately.

    Ctrl + Break: Force-stop a process if Ctrl + C fails.

    Ctrl + L: Clear Screen. Clears all text from the terminal view (similar to typing cls or clear) while keeping your history.

    Ctrl + Z: Suspend the current process (mostly used in Linux/WSL environments).

    Ctrl + S: Pause Output. Stop the terminal from scrolling while a process is running so you can read the logs.

    Ctrl + Q: Resume Output. Un-pause the terminal after using Ctrl + S.

VS Code Terminal Specifics

Since the VS Code terminal lives inside an IDE, it has its own set of "wrapper" shortcuts.

    Ctrl + ` (Backtick): Toggle the terminal window open and closed.

    Ctrl + Shift + `: Open a new terminal instance.

    Ctrl + \ (Backslash): Split terminal. View two terminal sessions side-by-side.

    Alt + Arrow Keys: Switch focus between split terminal panes.

    Ctrl + Shift + C: Open the current folder in an external command prompt window.

    Ctrl + Shift + V: Paste text into the terminal (standard Ctrl + V sometimes behaves differently depending on shell settings).

Power User & Search

    Ctrl + R: Reverse Search. Start typing a part of a command you used an hour ago; the shell will find it in your history.

    F7 (Command Prompt): Opens a graphical pop-up box with your command history.

    Alt + Enter: Toggle Full Screen mode for the terminal.

    Right-Click (In CMD): By default, right-clicking in the Windows terminal acts as "Paste."

    Ctrl + Shift + Up/Down: Scroll the terminal buffer up or down without moving the cursor.

    Pro Tip: In PowerShell, you can use the history command to see a numbered list of everything you've done in the session. You can then run a specific command by typing r [number].

Would you like me to explain how to customize your terminal "profile" (like changing colors or fonts) to make it easier to read during long coding sessions?

yes! I didn't know that was possible, give me some industry standard changes to the terminal please that "Pro's" would use

Customizing your terminal isn't just about "aesthetic"—it's about reducing cognitive load. When you're looking at thousands of lines of code, you need the terminal to highlight what matters (errors, branches, paths) so your eyes don't have to work so hard.

Most professionals have moved away from the old-school "Command Prompt" and use Windows Terminal (the modern host for PowerShell and WSL).

Here are the industry-standard changes to make you look—and feel—like a pro.
1. Install a "Nerd Font" (Crucial)

Standard fonts can't render the icons that pros use (like the little GitHub branch icon or folder symbols).

    The Pro Choice: Download Cascadia Code NF or FiraCode Nerd Font.

    Why: These include Ligatures, where characters like -> or != transform into single, elegant symbols (→ or =), making code much more readable.

2. Move to "Oh My Posh" (The Industry Standard)

If you see a developer with a terminal that shows the current Git branch, the execution time of the last command, and a sleek arrow—they are likely using Oh My Posh.

    What it does: It's a "prompt engine." Instead of a boring C:\Users\Name>, it gives you a color-coded status bar.

    How to get it: Run winget install JanDeDobbeleer.OhMyPosh -s winget in PowerShell.

3. The "Power User" Color Schemes

The default "Matrix Green" or "Harsh Blue" is actually quite straining on the eyes. Pros usually use one of these three accessible schemes:

    Dracula: A high-contrast dark theme that is very popular.

    Solarized Dark: Designed based on how the human eye perceives color to reduce fatigue.

    Gruvbox: A "retro" warm theme that is very easy on the eyes for late-night sessions.

4. Essential PowerShell Profile Tweaks

You can create a "Profile" script that runs every time you open the terminal. Type notepad $PROFILE in PowerShell to edit it. Pros add these "Aliases" (shortcuts for commands):
Alias	What it does	Why it's useful
g	git	Saves thousands of keystrokes a day.
..	cd ..	Quickly jump up one folder level.
ll	ls -l	Lists files with full details (size, date) in an easy-to-read list.
code .	Opens VS Code	Instantly opens the current folder as a project in VS Code.
5. Windows Terminal Settings (The "JSON" file)

In Windows Terminal, hit Ctrl + , (Comma) to open Settings. For a pro setup, ensure these are toggled:

    Opacity: Set to 85% and enable Acrylic material. This gives a slight blur/transparency so you can see your code or documentation behind the terminal.

    Copy on Select: Set this to On. Anything you highlight is automatically copied to your clipboard—no Ctrl + C required.

    Starting Directory: Set this to %USERPROFILE% or your specific \Projects folder so you don't start in the System32 folder.

6. Predictable Text (PSReadLine)

Modern terminals can "predict" what you’re going to type based on your history.

    The Command: Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionSource History

    The Result: As you type, you'll see a greyed-out suggestion of your previous commands. Just hit the Right Arrow to auto-complete the whole line.
