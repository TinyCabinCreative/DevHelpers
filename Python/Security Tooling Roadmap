🛡️ Python Security Tooling & Automation – Portfolio Map
🟢 Tier 1: Core Security Automation (Foundational)

Goal: Show you can automate repetitive security tasks cleanly and safely.

1️⃣ Log File Analyzer (Security Events)

Concepts Covered

File I/O

Dictionaries & lists

Regex

Error handling

CSV / JSON

Logging

What it does

Parses auth, web, or firewall logs

Detects:

repeated failed logins

IP brute-force patterns

suspicious timestamps

Outputs a structured report (JSON/CSV)

Why recruiters care

“This is what SOC analysts actually do.”

Portfolio signal

Defensive thinking

Data parsing

Clean automation

2️⃣ Password Strength & Breach Checker

Concepts Covered

Functions

Regex

requests

Hashing (hashlib)

CLI arguments

Environment variables

What it does

Evaluates password strength

Checks password hashes against known breach APIs (k-Anon style)

Never sends plaintext passwords

Security flex

Understands privacy-preserving design

3️⃣ Automated File Integrity Monitor (FIM)

Concepts Covered

os, pathlib

Hashing

JSON persistence

Scheduled execution logic

Exceptions

What it does

Hashes files in monitored directories

Detects unauthorized changes

Alerts via console or log

Why it matters

This mirrors compliance tooling (PCI-DSS, SOC2)

🟡 Tier 2: Security Engineer Tools (Intermediate)

Goal: Show applied security knowledge + engineering discipline.

4️⃣ Network Scanner (Safe Recon Tool)

Concepts Covered

socket

subprocess

CLI tools

Exception handling

Timeouts

What it does

Scans open ports (TCP only)

Identifies basic service banners

Rate-limited & safe by default

⚠️ Clearly document ethical usage

5️⃣ Suspicious Process Detector

Concepts Covered

psutil

Iterators & generators

Sets

Logging

Performance awareness

What it does

Enumerates running processes

Flags:

unusual CPU usage

known bad process names

odd execution paths

Security realism

Mirrors EDR-lite behavior

6️⃣ JWT Token Analyzer

Concepts Covered

Base64

JSON parsing

CLI args

Error handling

Unit tests

What it does

Decodes JWTs

Flags:

missing expiry

weak algorithms

insecure claims

Big interview win

Shows web security fluency

🟠 Tier 3: SOC / Blue Team Automation (Advanced)

Goal: Demonstrate detection logic & operational thinking.

7️⃣ Log Correlation Engine

Concepts Covered

Multi-file ingestion

Generators

collections.Counter

Time-window analysis

Config-driven logic

What it does

Correlates:

web logs

auth logs

firewall logs

Detects attack chains across systems

Why this slaps

This is SIEM thinking without the SIEM.

8️⃣ IOC Scanner (Indicators of Compromise)

Concepts Covered

Regex

File scanning

Async basics

Hash comparison

Config files

What it does

Scans directories for:

known malicious hashes

suspicious domains/IPs

Outputs a risk report

9️⃣ Automated Threat Feed Ingestor

Concepts Covered

HTTP requests

Scheduling logic

JSON normalization

Deduplication

Error resilience

What it does

Pulls threat intel feeds

Normalizes IOCs

Stores for later scanning

Security maturity signal

Threat intelligence pipeline knowledge

🔴 Tier 4: Impressive / Differentiator Projects

Goal: Make reviewers stop scrolling.

🔟 Security Orchestration Engine (SOAR-Lite)

Concepts Covered

Modular architecture

Config-driven workflows

Subprocess execution

Logging & audit trails

Exception isolation

What it does

Runs automated playbooks:

If brute force → block IP

If IOC match → alert

Fully simulated, safe environment

Portfolio impact

“This person understands security ops.”

1️⃣1️⃣ Malware Metadata Analyzer (Non-Exec)

Concepts Covered

File metadata

Hashing

PE header parsing (safe)

Report generation

What it does

Analyzes suspicious binaries without execution

Extracts metadata & indicators

⚠️ Strong safety documentation required

1️⃣2️⃣ AI Abuse / Prompt Injection Simulator (Perfect for Hackergenics)

Concepts Covered

Python backend logic

JSON scenario configs

Scoring engines

CLI / API design

What it does

Simulates prompt injection attacks

Scores model vulnerability

Teaches defensive patterns

This is 🔥 aligned with your vision
